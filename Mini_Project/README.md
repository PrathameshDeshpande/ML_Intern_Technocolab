## Perkinson Disease Classification
## <div align="center" >:point_down::point_down:PROJECT DESCRIPTION</div>
**:star2::star2:The Following is A WebApp for Classification Of An Individual Into Having Perkinson Diseases Or Not. We Dataset Of University of Oxford, Made in Collaboration With The National Centre For Voice and Speech.The Dataset Contain Speech And Vocal Infromation Of Indviduals Having Diseases and Not.Based On This Information We Need to Classify Using XGBoost Algorithms.This App is Powered By Streamlit and Will Be Deployed Through Heroku Platform.:star2::star2:**

## <div align="center" >:point_down::point_down:What And How XGBoost Works</div>
**:star2::star2:XGboost Stand's For Extreme Boosting Algorithm Which Is a Optimized Version of Sklearn's Gradient Boosting Algorithm. Its A Boosting Algorithms Which Trains Pedictors Sequentially, Where Each Successor Is Being Trained On Its Residual Error. XGBoost Can be Used For Regression As Well As classification Task. It Was Initially Developed By Chen As a Part Of DMDL. XGBoost Is Extremly Fast,Scalable And Protable. XGboost Is Often An Important Component Of The Winning Entries In ML Competitions:star2::star2:**
